# foyer-api

Foyer is an API gateway build with PHP (Lumen Framework). This API gateway only used and developed for learning purposes and deeper understanding about how API gateway works. This project was heavily inspired from vrata - https://github.com/PoweredLocal/vrata and my senior in project. 

Foyer still under construction. Please be noted.
